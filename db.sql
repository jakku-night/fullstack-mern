/* Database for the management application */

    MVP Definition:
    The project tries to solve a problem I have now. Manage startups and help to invest some resources
    in certain kind of activities or personel. I'm concious it's not an easy task to do, but I'll
    try to make it possible.
    The main problem is how to organize the people who integrates the team and how to distribute
    the resources to them if I'm limited by those resources.
    Another problem is to manage the money. It's common to waste the money in things one not really
    need at this time. To save resources 'till the correct moment can be hard if we've not info
    about the current state of the startup.
    Also, it's usual to forget important events and to comunicate fast and efficiently some critical
    info with the teamates. So I'll try to implement some chat and alert systems to warn/agilizate the
    coms into the team.
